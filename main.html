	<h1>Goa</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		Goa, India's smallest state on the west coast, is famous for its stunning beaches, Portuguese colonial heritage (evident in Old Goa's churches and Panaji's architecture), vibrant culture, and tropical climate, attracting tourists with its unique blend of Indian and European influences, lively nightlife, adventure sports, and diverse cuisine, supported by tourism, mining, and agriculture. Liberated from Portuguese rule in 1961, it became India's 25th state in 1987, with Konkani and Marathi as official languages, and Panaji as its capital.
